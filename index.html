  <p style="font-family:arial;">Hi I'm Natalie! I am a high school student that lives in the greater Seattle area. I enjoy trying new things and you can usually find me reading, trying to make art, or hanging out with my friends.</p>
  <p style="font-family:arial;">  Likes: I like to draw, bake, hike, and listen to music!<br>
    Dislikes: I don't like tomatoes.</p>
  <p style="font-family:arial;"> A fun fact about me: I've never been out of the country but I would love to do more traveling if I get the opportunity to!</p>
  <p style="font-family:arial;"> Check out this side scroller game I helped make!<br>
<img src="pic_scroller_game.png" alt="Picture of scroller game" style="width:405px;height:340px;">
  <p style="font-family:arial;"> To make my website accessible to all users I made sure to include the language that my website is in when coding so it can be translated by screen readers.</p>
  <p style="font-family:arial;"> Some things that other people used on their websites that looked cool to me were boxes around headings and columns to create unique layouts.</p>
  <p style="font-family:arial;"> I am most proud of learning how to change the color and font of text and being able to put boxes around text because by doing all these things I can further customize my website.</p>

  <p style="font-family:arial;">Hi I'm Natalie! I am a high school student that lives in the greater Seattle area. I enjoy trying new things and you can usually find me reading, trying to make art, or hanging out with my friends.</p>
  <p style="font-family:arial;">  Likes: I like to draw, bake, hike, and listen to music!<br>
    Dislikes: I don't like tomatoes.</p>
  <p style="font-family:arial;"> A fun fact about me: I've never been out of the country but I would love to do more traveling if I get the opportunity to!</p>
  <p style="font-family:arial;"> Check out this side scroller game I helped make!<br>
